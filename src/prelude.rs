//! Prelude module providing commonly used types and imports
//!
//! This module consolidates frequently imported types to reduce import duplication
//! across the codebase and improve maintainability.
//!
//! Note: This prelude is currently empty as all previously exported items
//! are directly imported where needed. This file is kept for potential
//! future common imports.
