# Implement Deleted Postings Tracking

## Description
Deleted postings tracking is not implemented yet, as noted in `shardex_index.rs:1300`. This is currently hardcoded to 0.

## Current State
```rust
deleted_postings: 0, // Deleted postings tracking not implemented yet
```

## Requirements
- Implement proper deleted postings counting
- Track when postings are marked as deleted
- Maintain statistics for deleted vs active postings
- Update monitoring and reporting systems

## Files Affected
- `src/shardex_index.rs:1300`

## Priority
Medium - Monitoring and statistics feature

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I found that:

1. **Current State**: The `deleted_postings` field is hardcoded to `0` in `shardex_index.rs:1279`
2. **Deletion Mechanism**: The system already tracks deleted postings at the shard level:
   - `vector_storage.rs` uses NaN markers to mark deleted vectors
   - `posting_storage.rs` uses a deletion bitmap to track deleted postings
   - Both storages maintain an `active_count` that decreases when items are deleted

3. **Missing Logic**: The `ShardexIndex::stats()` method doesn't aggregate deleted postings from individual shards

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Modify the `statistics()` method in ShardexIndex** to calculate actual deleted postings by:
   - Iterating through all cached shards and calling their `deleted_count()` methods
   - For uncached shards, calculate deleted count as `total_count - active_count` from metadata

2. **Update the `stats()` method** to use the calculated deleted postings instead of hardcoded `0`

3. **Ensure consistency** between `active_postings` and `deleted_postings` calculations

4. **Add comprehensive tests** to verify the tracking works correctly with document deletions

### Key Files to Modify:
- `src/shardex_index.rs`: Update `statistics()` and `stats()` methods
- Add tests to verify deleted postings tracking works correctly

This approach leverages the existing deletion tracking infrastructure at the shard level and properly aggregates it at the index level.

## Implementation Progress

### Changes Made:

1. **Added `calculate_posting_counts()` method** in `ShardexIndex`:
   - For cached shards: Uses actual `active_count()` and `current_count()` from shard instances
   - For uncached shards: Estimates based on utilization and capacity from metadata
   - Returns tuple of `(active_postings, deleted_postings)`

2. **Updated `stats()` method** in `ShardexIndex`:
   - Removed hardcoded `deleted_postings: 0`
   - Now calls `calculate_posting_counts()` to get actual active/deleted counts
   - Uses calculated values instead of assumptions

3. **Added comprehensive test** `test_deleted_postings_tracking`:
   - Tests initial state (no deletions)
   - Tests after single document deletion
   - Tests after multiple document deletions  
   - Verifies total, active, and deleted posting counts are accurate

### Key Design Decisions:

- **Hybrid Approach**: Uses actual shard data when cached, estimates when uncached for performance
- **Backward Compatibility**: No changes to existing data structures or APIs
- **Accurate Tracking**: Leverages existing deletion infrastructure in shards (NaN markers for vectors, deletion bitmaps for postings)

### Files Modified:
- `src/shardex_index.rs`: Added `calculate_posting_counts()` method, updated `stats()` method, added test
## Implementation Complete âœ…

### Summary
Successfully implemented proper deleted postings tracking in ShardexIndex. The hardcoded `deleted_postings: 0` has been replaced with actual calculation logic that aggregates deletion information from all shards.

### Technical Approach
1. **Added `calculate_posting_counts()` helper method** that:
   - Gets actual counts from cached shards using `active_count()` and `current_count()`
   - Estimates counts for uncached shards using utilization ratios
   - Handles edge cases with `saturating_sub()` to prevent underflow
   
2. **Updated `stats()` method** to use calculated values instead of hardcoded zeros

3. **Preserved performance** by avoiding unnecessary shard loading for uncached shards

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test `test_deleted_postings_tracking` 
- Verifies accurate counts before/after document deletions
- Tests multiple deletion scenarios

### Verification
- Code compiles without errors related to this change
- Implementation follows existing patterns and conventions
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
