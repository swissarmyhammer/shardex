# Step 34: WAL-Based Crash Recovery

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement comprehensive crash recovery using Write-Ahead Log replay with consistency validation.

## Tasks
- Create crash detection and recovery initialization
- Implement complete WAL replay with progress tracking
- Add consistency validation after recovery
- Support partial recovery from corrupted WAL segments
- Include recovery performance optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Crash detection identifies incomplete operations
- [ ] WAL replay restores all committed transactions
- [ ] Consistency validation ensures recovered state is valid
- [ ] Partial recovery handles corrupted segments gracefully
- [ ] Tests verify recovery correctness for various crash scenarios
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for large WAL files

## Technical Details
```rust
pub struct CrashRecovery {
    index_directory: PathBuf,
    config: ShardexConfig,
    recovery_stats: RecoveryStats,
}

impl CrashRecovery {
    pub async fn detect_crash(&self) -> Result<bool, ShardexError>;
    pub async fn recover(&mut self) -> Result<ShardexIndex, ShardexError>;
    pub async fn validate_consistency(&self, index: &ShardexIndex) -> Result<(), ShardexError>;
}
```

Include comprehensive logging and progress reporting during recovery operations.
## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase, I found that Shardex already has significant WAL and replay infrastructure:

- **WalSegment**: Fixed-size memory-mapped WAL segments with atomic operations
- **WalReplayer**: WAL replay engine with transaction processing and progress tracking  
- **RecoveryStats**: Comprehensive statistics and error tracking
- **Integrity validation**: Header validation and checksum verification

### Implementation Plan

1. **CrashRecovery Module**: Create a high-level crash recovery coordinator that:
   - Detects crashes by checking for incomplete operations (lock files, partial writes)
   - Orchestrates the recovery process using existing WalReplayer
   - Provides progress reporting and performance metrics
   - Validates consistency after recovery completion

2. **Enhanced Crash Detection**: Implement robust crash detection:
   - Check for recovery lock files indicating incomplete operations
   - Validate index metadata consistency 
   - Detect corrupted or incomplete WAL segments
   - Support graceful degradation for partial corruption

3. **Recovery Coordination**: Coordinate recovery using existing infrastructure:
   - Use WalReplayer for actual transaction replay
   - Enhance RecoveryStats for crash recovery specific metrics
   - Add recovery performance optimization (concurrent segment processing where safe)
   - Provide detailed progress reporting throughout recovery

4. **Consistency Validation**: Post-recovery validation:
   - Verify shard structure integrity using existing validation
   - Cross-validate WAL state against index state
   - Ensure no transaction gaps or inconsistencies
   - Report validation results with detailed metrics

5. **Partial Recovery Support**: Handle corrupted segments gracefully:
   - Skip corrupted segments with proper error reporting
   - Recover what's possible from partial corruption
   - Provide detailed corruption reports for manual intervention
   - Continue recovery even with some segment failures

### Technical Implementation

The solution will build on existing infrastructure while adding the crash recovery coordination layer. The CrashRecovery struct will use composition to leverage WalReplayer and other existing components, ensuring consistency with current patterns.
## Implementation Results

### Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive WAL-based crash recovery functionality that meets all acceptance criteria. The implementation leverages existing WAL and replay infrastructure while adding a coordinated recovery layer with extensive validation and progress tracking.

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. CrashRecovery Module (`src/crash_recovery.rs`)
- **CrashRecovery** coordinator struct with crash detection, recovery orchestration, and validation
- **CrashRecoveryStats** comprehensive statistics with performance metrics and error tracking  
- Full integration with existing WalReplayer and ShardexIndex infrastructure
- Atomic recovery operations with proper cleanup and lock file management

#### 2. Enhanced Crash Detection
- **Recovery lock detection** - identifies incomplete recovery operations
- **Metadata validation** - checks for corrupted or missing index metadata
- **WAL segment integrity** - validates existing WAL segments for corruption
- **State consistency checks** - detects mismatched WAL/metadata states

#### 3. Coordinated Recovery Process
- **Progress tracking** with detailed timing metrics for each recovery phase
- **Partial recovery support** for corrupted segments with graceful degradation
- **Consistency validation** using existing shard integrity validation
- **Performance optimization** through existing parallel WAL replay infrastructure

#### 4. Comprehensive Testing (`tests/crash_recovery_tests.rs`)
- **11 integration tests** covering all major crash scenarios
- **Performance validation** ensuring acceptable recovery times
- **Concurrent safety testing** for multi-process environments
- **Edge case coverage** including corrupted segments and partial failures

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Crash Detection (`detect_crash()`)
```rust
// Detects multiple types of crash scenarios:
// - Recovery lock files indicating interrupted operations  
// - Empty or missing metadata files
// - WAL segments without corresponding metadata
// - Corrupted WAL segment integrity
```

#### Recovery Coordination (`recover()`)
```rust  
// Orchestrates complete recovery process:
// 1. Create recovery lock for atomic operations
// 2. Open/create index with proper error handling
// 3. Use existing WalReplayer for transaction replay
// 4. Validate recovered index consistency
// 5. Clean up recovery lock and update statistics
```

#### Consistency Validation (`validate_consistency()`) 
```rust
// Post-recovery validation ensures:
// - All shard files exist and are accessible
// - Shard integrity validation passes
// - Index metadata consistency is maintained
// - No transaction gaps or inconsistencies exist
```

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
