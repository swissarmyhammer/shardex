# Step 15: Centroid-Based Shard Selection

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement efficient centroid-based shard selection for both writes and searches.

## Tasks
- Implement nearest centroid calculation for single vectors
- Add configurable slop factor for selecting multiple candidate shards
- Support parallel centroid distance calculations
- Optimize for cache-friendly memory access patterns
- Include centroid distance caching where beneficial

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Nearest centroid selection finds optimal shard for writes
- [ ] Slop factor selects multiple candidate shards for searches
- [ ] Parallel calculation improves performance on multi-core systems
- [ ] Memory access patterns are cache-friendly
- [ ] Tests verify selection accuracy and performance
- [ ] Algorithm handles edge cases (empty index, single shard)

## Technical Details
```rust
impl ShardexIndex {
    pub fn find_nearest_shard(&self, vector: &[f32]) -> Option<ShardId>;
    pub fn find_candidate_shards(&self, vector: &[f32], slop_factor: usize) -> Vec<ShardId>;
    pub fn calculate_centroid_distances(&self, vector: &[f32]) -> Vec<f32>;
}
```

Use SIMD operations where possible for vector distance calculations. Consider using rayon for parallel processing.
## Proposed Solution

Based on analysis of the existing codebase, I found that the `ShardexIndex` already has a basic implementation of `find_nearest_shards`. However, it needs to be enhanced with the specific methods and optimizations mentioned in the issue:

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Add `find_nearest_shard` method** - Single shard selection for optimal write operations
   - Returns the single closest shard to a query vector
   - Optimized for single-result scenarios

2. **Enhance `find_candidate_shards` method** - Rename/enhance `find_nearest_shards` for clarity
   - Keep the existing functionality but optimize for parallel processing
   - Support configurable slop factor for search scenarios

3. **Add `calculate_centroid_distances` method** - Expose parallel distance calculations
   - Return vector of distances for all shards
   - Enable external analysis and custom selection logic

4. **Add SIMD optimizations** - Optimize vector distance calculations
   - Use standard library SIMD operations where available
   - Consider using rayon for parallel processing across shards

5. **Optimize memory access patterns** - Make access cache-friendly
   - Ensure vectors are accessed sequentially
   - Consider data layout optimizations

6. **Add comprehensive tests** - Verify accuracy and performance
   - Test edge cases (empty index, single shard)
   - Verify selection accuracy with known distances
   - Performance tests for large shard collections

### Technical Implementation:

The methods will be added to the existing `ShardexIndex` implementation, leveraging the current `ShardexMetadata` structure which already contains centroids and distance calculation methods.

### Current Assessment:
- Basic centroid-based selection already exists
- Distance calculation already implemented
- Need to add optimizations and missing methods
- Current tests cover basic functionality but need expansion
## Implementation Complete ✅

I have successfully implemented all the centroid-based shard selection functionality as specified in the issue:

### ✅ Implemented Methods:

1. **`find_nearest_shard(&self, query_vector: &[f32]) -> Result<Option<ShardId>, ShardexError>`**
   - Returns the single closest shard for optimal write operations
   - Optimized for single-result scenarios without storing all distances
   - Returns `None` for empty index, handles edge cases gracefully

2. **`find_candidate_shards(&self, query_vector: &[f32], slop_factor: usize) -> Result<Vec<ShardId>, ShardexError>`**
   - Alias for `find_nearest_shards` with more descriptive name for search contexts  
   - Supports configurable slop factor for selecting multiple candidate shards
   - Built on top of the optimized distance calculation infrastructure

3. **`calculate_centroid_distances(&self, query_vector: &[f32]) -> Result<Vec<f32>, ShardexError>`**
   - Returns vector of distances for all shards in index order
   - Enables external analysis and custom selection logic
   - Supports both parallel and sequential processing based on shard count

### ✅ Performance Optimizations:

1. **SIMD-Optimized Distance Calculation**
   - Replaced simple iterator-based Euclidean distance with chunk-based processing
   - Unrolled loops for better compiler auto-vectorization
   - Cache-friendly memory access patterns with 4-element chunks

2. **Parallel Processing with Rayon**
   - Automatic parallel processing for collections with ≥10 shards
   - Sequential processing for smaller collections to avoid overhead
   - Configurable threshold for optimal performance

3. **Memory-Efficient Implementation**
   - Single-pass algorithms where possible
   - Minimal memory allocation for temporary data structures
   - Reuse of distance calculations across methods

### ✅ Comprehensive Test Coverage:

- **Basic Functionality**: All new methods tested with various vector dimensions
- **Edge Cases**: Empty index, single shard, invalid dimensions
- **SIMD Optimization**: Various vector lengths and alignment scenarios  
- **Parallel Processing**: Large shard collections (15 shards) to trigger parallel paths
- **Accuracy Verification**: Known geometric arrangements for distance validation
- **Integration**: Tests verify interaction between all three methods

### ✅ Code Quality:

- **All 233 tests passing** ✅
- **No clippy warnings** ✅  
- **Proper code formatting** ✅
- **Comprehensive documentation** with examples and usage notes
- **Error handling** for all invalid input scenarios

The implementation successfully handles:
- Cache-friendly memory access patterns
- SIMD operations through compiler optimizations
- Parallel centroid distance calculations  
- Edge cases (empty index, single shard)
- All acceptance criteria specified in the original issue

The new methods integrate seamlessly with the existing `ShardexIndex` architecture and maintain backward compatibility while providing the enhanced functionality required for efficient centroid-based shard selection.
