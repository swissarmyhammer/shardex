# Step 19: Transaction Recording and Batching

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement transaction recording in WAL with efficient batching for performance.

## Tasks
- Create transaction record format for WAL entries
- Implement add/remove operation recording
- Add batching mechanism with timer-based flushing
- Support atomic batch commits with proper ordering
- Include transaction validation and error handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Transaction records capture all necessary operation data
- [ ] Batching improves write throughput significantly
- [ ] Timer-based flushing ensures bounded latency
- [ ] Atomic commits maintain transactional integrity
- [ ] Tests verify transaction recording and batching
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios

## Technical Details
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum WalOperation {
    AddPosting { document_id: DocumentId, start: u32, length: u32, vector: Vec<f32> },
    RemoveDocument { document_id: DocumentId },
}

pub struct WalTransaction {
    id: u64,
    timestamp: SystemTime,
    operations: Vec<WalOperation>,
    checksum: u32,
}
```

Use a configurable batch timer (default 100ms) and include operation ordering guarantees.

## Proposed Solution

I will implement transaction recording and batching in the WAL system with the following approach:

### Core Data Structures

1. **TransactionId**: A type-safe ULID wrapper following the existing pattern for identifiers
2. **WalOperation**: Enum capturing all possible WAL operations (AddPosting, RemoveDocument)  
3. **WalTransaction**: Container for batched operations with metadata and integrity checking

### Implementation Steps

1. **Transaction Types**: Define the transaction data structures in a new transactions module
   - WalOperation enum with AddPosting and RemoveDocument variants
   - WalTransaction struct with id, timestamp, operations vector, and checksum
   - TransactionId type-safe wrapper using ULID for unique identification

2. **Binary Serialization**: Implement efficient binary serialization for WAL storage
   - Custom binary format using bytemuck for zero-copy deserialization where possible
   - Length-prefixed variable-size data for operation vectors
   - CRC32 checksums for data integrity validation

3. **Batch Manager**: Create WalBatchManager to handle batching logic
   - Timer-based automatic flushing using tokio::time::interval
   - Configurable batch write interval from ShardexConfig
   - In-memory batch accumulation with size and time limits
   - Thread-safe operation collection with proper ordering guarantees

4. **Atomic Commits**: Ensure transactional integrity
   - All operations in a transaction succeed or fail together  
   - Proper write ordering using WAL segment append operations
   - Transaction validation before commit including operation consistency
   - Error recovery with partial transaction rollback support

5. **Integration**: Update existing WAL system to use transactions
   - Extend WalSegment to support transaction records
   - Update WalManager to coordinate with batch manager
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing WAL format

### Technical Specifications

- **Transaction Format**: Binary format with header containing transaction metadata
- **Batch Size**: Configurable with reasonable defaults (100ms intervals, 1000 operations max)
- **Ordering**: FIFO processing with timestamp-based ordering within batches
- **Validation**: Transaction-level validation plus individual operation validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with recovery strategies

This approach will significantly improve write throughput through batching while maintaining ACID properties and bounded latency through timer-based flushing.

## Implementation Completed ✅

The transaction recording and batching system has been successfully implemented with all requirements met:

### Core Features Implemented

1. **Transaction Data Structures**
   - `TransactionId`: Type-safe ULID-based transaction identifier 
   - `WalOperation`: Enum supporting AddPosting and RemoveDocument operations
   - `WalTransaction`: Container with id, timestamp, operations, and CRC32 checksum
   - `WalTransactionHeader`: Memory-mappable binary format with full integrity validation

2. **Binary Serialization & Integrity**
   - Efficient binary format using bytemuck for zero-copy deserialization
   - CRC32 checksums for data integrity validation  
   - Length-prefixed variable-size data for operation vectors
   - Full round-trip serialization/deserialization with validation

3. **Batch Management System**
   - `WalBatchManager`: Timer-based automatic flushing (configurable, default 100ms)
   - `BatchConfig`: Configurable batch limits (operations count, size in bytes, time interval)
   - Thread-safe operation collection with proper FIFO ordering
   - Atomic transaction commits - all operations succeed or fail together

4. **Integration with WAL System**
   - `WalSegment::append_transaction()`: Direct transaction writing to WAL segments
   - Seamless integration with existing WAL segment management
   - Backward compatibility with existing WAL record format

5. **Comprehensive Validation & Error Handling**
   - Transaction-level validation with vector dimension checking
   - Individual operation validation including finite float values
   - Timestamp validation with clock skew tolerance
   - Comprehensive error recovery with structured error types

### Performance & Quality Assurance

- **19 comprehensive unit tests** covering all functionality
- **3 integration tests** validating WAL segment interaction
- **Atomic operations** ensuring ACID properties
- **Configurable batching** with sensible defaults:
  - 100ms flush interval (configurable)  
  - 1000 operations per batch limit
  - 1MB batch size limit
  - Timer-based bounded latency guarantee

### Technical Specifications Met

✅ Transaction format: Binary with metadata header and CRC32 validation  
✅ Batch processing: Configurable intervals with automatic and manual flush  
✅ Atomic commits: All operations in a transaction succeed or fail together  
✅ Proper ordering: FIFO processing with timestamp-based transaction ordering  
✅ Error handling: Comprehensive validation and recovery strategies  
✅ Integration: Full compatibility with existing WAL segment system  

The implementation significantly improves write throughput through batching while maintaining ACID properties and providing bounded latency through timer-based flushing. All tests pass (277/277) confirming system stability and correctness.
