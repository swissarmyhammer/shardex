# Step 29: Add Postings Transaction Handling

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement complete transaction handling for adding postings with WAL integration and error recovery.

## Tasks
- Create add postings transaction workflow
- Implement WAL recording before shard updates
- Add transaction rollback on failures
- Support batch posting additions
- Include transaction validation and integrity checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add operations are recorded in WAL before shard updates
- [ ] Transaction rollback restores consistent state on failures
- [ ] Batch operations improve performance for large additions
- [ ] Validation prevents invalid postings from being added
- [ ] Tests verify transaction correctness and error handling
- [ ] ACID properties are maintained throughout operations

## Technical Details
```rust
impl Shardex {
    pub async fn add_postings(&mut self, postings: Vec<Posting>) -> Result<(), ShardexError>;
    
    async fn add_postings_transaction(&mut self, postings: Vec<Posting>) -> Result<(), ShardexError> {
        // 1. Validate all postings
        // 2. Record in WAL
        // 3. Apply to shards
        // 4. Update bloom filters
        // 5. Update centroids
        // 6. Advance WAL pointer
    }
}
```

Include comprehensive validation, atomic operations, and proper error propagation.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase, I can see that most of the infrastructure is already in place:

- **WalTransaction and WalOperation**: Complete transaction structure with validation and serialization
- **WalBatchManager**: Efficient batching with configurable limits and timer-based flushing  
- **WalSegment**: Memory-mapped WAL storage with atomic operations
- **ShardexIndex**: Index management with parallel search capabilities
- **Validation infrastructure**: Comprehensive error handling and data validation

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Transaction Workflow Integration**: 
   - Integrate WalBatchManager into ShardexImpl for automatic batching
   - Use existing WalOperation::AddPosting for recording operations
   - Leverage timer-based flushing (100ms default) for performance

2. **WAL-First Architecture**:
   - Record all add_postings operations in WAL before applying to shards
   - Use WalTransaction for atomic batch commits
   - Implement proper error propagation from WAL writes

3. **Shard Update Process**:
   - After WAL commit, apply postings to appropriate shards using existing shard infrastructure
   - Use ShardexIndex.find_nearest_shards() for optimal shard selection
   - Update bloom filters and centroids as part of transaction

4. **Error Recovery**:
   - Failed WAL writes prevent any shard modifications (fail-fast)
   - Use existing WAL replay infrastructure for crash recovery
   - Implement transaction rollback by not advancing WAL pointer on failures

5. **Batch Performance Optimization**:
   - Use existing BatchConfig for tunable performance (max 1000 ops, 1MB batches)
   - Support concurrent add_postings calls through async batch manager
   - Maintain ACID properties through WAL-first approach

### Key Components to Implement

1. **ShardexImpl.add_postings()** - Main API method with WAL integration
2. **Transaction validation** - Vector dimension and posting validation  
3. **WAL integration** - Connect batch manager to WAL segments
4. **Shard application** - Apply committed transactions to shards
5. **Error handling** - Comprehensive rollback and recovery

The existing infrastructure provides strong foundations for ACID compliance, efficient batching, and proper error handling. The implementation will focus on connecting these components into a complete transaction workflow.
