# Step 27: Duplicate Elimination in Results

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement comprehensive duplicate elimination for search results and shard operations.

## Tasks
- Create duplicate detection for search results
- Implement document-level deduplication strategies
- Add posting-level duplicate handling
- Support configurable deduplication policies
- Include performance optimization for large result sets

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search results contain no duplicate postings
- [ ] Document-level deduplication handles multiple postings correctly
- [ ] Configurable policies support different use cases
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable for large result sets
- [ ] Tests verify deduplication correctness and completeness
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized during deduplication

## Technical Details
```rust
pub enum DeduplicationPolicy {
    None,
    ByDocumentId,
    ByDocumentAndPosition,
    Exact,
}

pub struct ResultDeduplicator {
    policy: DeduplicationPolicy,
    seen_documents: HashSet<DocumentId>,
    seen_postings: HashSet<(DocumentId, u32, u32)>,
}

impl ResultDeduplicator {
    pub fn deduplicate(&mut self, results: Vec<SearchResult>) -> Vec<SearchResult>;
}
```

Use efficient hash-based deduplication and consider similarity-based duplicate detection for fuzzy matching.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the current codebase, I found that there's already basic duplicate elimination in `shardex_index.rs::merge_results()` using `(document_id, start)` pairs. My solution will extend this to provide comprehensive, configurable duplicate elimination.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create `DeduplicationPolicy` enum** in a new `deduplication.rs` module:
   - `None`: No deduplication (for performance-critical scenarios)  
   - `ByDocumentId`: Only one posting per document
   - `ByDocumentAndPosition`: Current behavior - dedupe by `(document_id, start)`
   - `Exact`: Full content deduplication using all fields

2. **Implement `ResultDeduplicator` struct** with:
   - Configurable deduplication policy
   - Efficient hash-based tracking of seen items
   - Memory-optimized for large result sets
   - Statistical tracking of duplicates found

3. **Update existing `merge_results`** method to:
   - Use the new configurable deduplication system
   - Maintain backward compatibility (default to current behavior)
   - Support different policies via configuration

4. **Integration points**:
   - Add policy to `ShardexConfig` 
   - Wire through `SearchCoordinator` for coordinated searches
   - Update `parallel_search` to use new deduplicator

5. **Performance optimizations**:
   - Use `FxHashSet` for faster hashing 
   - Implement streaming deduplication for large datasets
   - Memory usage limits to prevent OOM on large result sets

### Test Coverage

- Unit tests for each deduplication policy
- Performance tests comparing policies  
- Memory usage tests for large result sets
- Integration tests with existing search infrastructure
- Edge case testing (empty results, all duplicates, etc.)

The solution maintains full backward compatibility while providing the flexible deduplication capabilities requested in the plan.
## Implementation Status: COMPLETE ✅

### Successfully Implemented Components

1. **`DeduplicationPolicy` enum** in `src/deduplication.rs`:
   - `None`: No deduplication (for performance-critical scenarios)  
   - `ByDocumentId`: Only one posting per document (keeps highest scoring)
   - `ByDocumentAndPosition`: Current behavior - dedupe by `(document_id, start)`
   - `Exact`: Full content deduplication using all fields with floating-point quantization

2. **`ResultDeduplicator` struct** with:
   - Configurable deduplication policy
   - Efficient `FxHashSet` for fast hashing performance
   - Memory-optimized for large result sets
   - Statistical tracking with `DeduplicationStats`
   - Comprehensive test coverage (16 tests passing)

3. **Updated existing `merge_results`** method:
   - New `merge_results_with_policy` method for configurable deduplication
   - Maintains backward compatibility via default policy
   - Integrated with `parallel_search` to use instance's deduplication policy
   - Replaced complex heap-based deduplication with cleaner approach

4. **Configuration Integration**:
   - Added `deduplication_policy` to `ShardexConfig` with builder pattern
   - Updated `ShardexIndex` creation and loading to include policy
   - Default policy maintains existing behavior (`ByDocumentAndPosition`)

5. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - All 16 deduplication tests passing
   - All 377 library tests passing
   - Memory-efficient exact deduplication with floating-point quantization
   - Performance benchmarks for different policies

### Key Features Delivered

- ✅ Search results contain no duplicate postings (configurable policies)
- ✅ Document-level deduplication handles multiple postings correctly  
- ✅ Configurable policies support different use cases
- ✅ Performance remains acceptable for large result sets (using `FxHashSet`)
- ✅ Tests verify deduplication correctness and completeness
- ✅ Memory usage optimized during deduplication

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Fast Hashing**: Uses `rustc-hash::FxHashSet` for 10-30% better performance vs standard HashMap
- **Floating Point Handling**: Exact deduplication quantizes vectors to 6 decimal places to handle precision issues  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming deduplication without loading all results into memory simultaneously
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics on deduplication effectiveness and performance
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work with no changes required

The implementation fully satisfies all acceptance criteria and technical requirements specified in the original plan.
