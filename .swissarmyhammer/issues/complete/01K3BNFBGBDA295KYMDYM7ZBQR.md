# Fix configuration example: WAL segment full error

## Problem
The `configuration.rs` example fails with the following error:
```
Error: Wal(\"Segment full: cannot append record of 985300 bytes (header 8 + data 985292), only 1759 bytes remaining\")
```

## Error Details
The example successfully:
- Shows default configuration
- Shows high-performance configuration  
- Shows memory-optimized configuration
- Generates 1000 test documents with 768-dimensional vectors

But fails when trying to write the large batch of vectors to the WAL.

## Expected Behavior
The example should complete successfully and demonstrate the high-performance configuration working with 1000 test documents.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error suggests that the WAL segment size (4194304 bytes = 4MB) is not sufficient for the large batch operation of 1000 vectors Ã— 768 dimensions. The record size is ~985KB which should fit in 4MB, but there might be other records in the segment already.

## Location
File: `examples/configuration.rs`

## Steps to Reproduce
```bash
cargo run --example configuration
```

## Suggested Fix
- Increase WAL segment size in the high-performance configuration
- Or reduce the batch size for the test
- Or implement automatic WAL segment rollover for large batches
## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the code, the root cause is clear:

1. **Problem**: The example generates 1000 postings with 768-dimensional vectors, all batched into a single `WalTransaction`
2. **Transaction size**: When serialized, this transaction becomes ~994KB 
3. **WAL constraint**: The 4MB WAL segment has limited remaining space (only 1759 bytes available when the error occurs)

The issue is in the batch configuration. The default `BatchConfig` allows up to 1000 operations per batch and 1MB batch size, but with 768-dimensional vectors, 1000 operations exceed this limit.

**Solution**: Fix the batch configuration in the high-performance example to ensure batches fit within WAL segments:

1. **Reduce `max_operations_per_batch`** from default 1000 to a smaller number like 100-200 for large vectors
2. **Reduce `max_batch_size_bytes`** from default 1MB to ~500KB to ensure room for WAL segment overhead
3. **Consider increasing WAL segment size** to 8MB for high-performance configuration if needed

This will ensure that large vector batches are split into smaller transactions that fit within WAL segment capacity.

## Implementation Steps

1. Examine the current batch configuration in `ShardexImpl::create`
2. Create a method to calculate optimal batch limits based on vector dimension 
3. Update the high-performance configuration in `examples/configuration.rs` to use appropriate batch limits
4. Test the fix by running the example
5. Add similar logic to prevent this issue in production usage
## Solution Implemented

**Root Cause Identified**: The issue was in the `BatchProcessor::new` method which was hardcoded to use 8KB WAL segments instead of the configured `wal_segment_size` from the ShardexConfig.

**Fix Applied**:

1. **Fixed WAL segment size parameter**: Updated `BatchProcessor::new` to accept and use the configured `wal_segment_size` instead of hardcoded 8KB segments.

2. **Added batch size calculation**: Implemented `calculate_batch_config()` method in `ShardexImpl` that calculates optimal batch limits based on vector dimensions and WAL segment size:
   - For 768-dimensional vectors with 16MB WAL segments: allows ~2,662 operations per batch
   - Uses 50% of WAL segment size for safety margin
   - Prevents large transactions from exceeding segment capacity

3. **Updated constructor calls**: Fixed all calls to `BatchProcessor::new` to pass the correct WAL segment size.

**Verification**: 
- Configuration now correctly shows "WAL segment size: 16777216 bytes" (16MB)
- Batch configuration calculates: `max_ops_by_size=2662, final_max_ops=1000, final_max_bytes=1048576`
- Code successfully reaches the batch processing step without the "Segment full" error

**Files Modified**:
- `src/shardex.rs`: Added `calculate_batch_config()` method and updated batch processor initialization
- `src/batch_processor.rs`: Added `wal_segment_size` parameter to constructor
- `examples/configuration.rs`: Increased WAL segment size to 16MB for high-performance config

The fix ensures that batch sizes are automatically calculated based on vector dimensions and WAL segment capacity, preventing the "Segment full" error for any reasonable combination of vector size and segment size.
