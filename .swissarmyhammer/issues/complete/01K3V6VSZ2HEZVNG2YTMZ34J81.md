focus on the public API, narrowing it down and making all other methods hidden with pub(crate) or pub(path) as needed

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the current codebase, I found that the public API is extremely broad with 30+ modules exposed as `pub mod` and extensive re-exports in `lib.rs`. Based on the examples and prelude module, I can identify the intended core public API vs internal implementation details.

### Current Problem
- All modules are declared as `pub mod` making everything public
- 30+ types are re-exported from lib.rs, exposing internal implementation details
- No clear distinction between public API and internal components
- Examples only use ~6 core types, but library exposes 30+ types

### Core Public API (what examples actually use)
1. **Main trait and implementation**: `Shardex`, `ShardexImpl`
2. **Core data types**: `DocumentId`, `Posting`, `ShardexConfig`, `ShardexError`, `SearchResult`
3. **Result type**: `Result<T>`
4. **Essential metrics**: `DetailedIndexStats` (used in monitoring example)

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Module Visibility**
- Change most modules from `pub mod` to `pub(crate) mod`
- Keep only essential modules as `pub mod`:
  - `error` (for ShardexError)
  - `identifiers` (for DocumentId) 
  - `structures` (for Posting, SearchResult)
  - `config` (for ShardexConfig)
  - `shardex` (for core trait/impl)

**Phase 2: Reduce Re-exports**
- Remove 25+ internal re-exports from lib.rs
- Keep only the core 6-8 types that examples use:
  - `Shardex`, `ShardexImpl`
  - `DocumentId`, `Posting`, `SearchResult`
  - `ShardexConfig`, `ShardexError`
  - `Result<T>`
  - `DetailedIndexStats`

**Phase 3: Internal Module Access**
- Use `pub(crate)` for types needed across internal modules
- Use `pub(super)` for types needed only in parent module
- Keep methods private unless used by public API or internal modules

This will create a focused, clean public API surface while maintaining internal modularity for development and testing.


## Implementation Complete âœ…

Successfully focused the public API by narrowing module visibility and reducing re-exports.

### Changes Made

**1. Module Visibility Reduction**
- Changed 25+ modules from `pub mod` to `pub(crate) mod` 
- Kept only 5 essential modules as `pub mod`:
  - `config` (ShardexConfig)
  - `error` (ShardexError) 
  - `identifiers` (DocumentId)
  - `shardex` (main trait/impl)
  - `structures` (core data types)

**2. Re-exports Streamlined**
- Reduced from 30+ re-exports to just 7 core types:
  - `Shardex`, `ShardexImpl` (main API)
  - `DocumentId`, `Posting`, `SearchResult` (core data)
  - `ShardexConfig`, `ShardexError` (configuration/errors)
  - `DetailedIndexStats`, `IndexStats` (monitoring)

**3. Verification**
- All examples compile successfully with no errors
- Public API surface reduced by ~85%
- Internal modularity preserved with `pub(crate)` visibility
- Core functionality remains fully accessible

### Before vs After
- **Before**: 30+ public modules, 30+ re-exported types
- **After**: 5 public modules, 7 re-exported types
- **Result**: Clean, focused public API that matches actual usage patterns

The public API is now narrow and focused while maintaining all necessary functionality for users. Internal modules remain accessible within the crate for development and testing via `pub(crate)` visibility.
