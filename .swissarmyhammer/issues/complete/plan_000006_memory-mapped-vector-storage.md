# Step 6: Memory-Mapped Vector Storage

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement fixed-size memory-mapped storage for embedding vectors with direct access capabilities.

## Tasks
- Create VectorStorage struct for memory-mapped vector arrays
- Implement fixed-size allocation with configurable dimensions
- Add direct vector access without copying
- Support vector addition, removal, and updates
- Ensure proper alignment for SIMD operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] VectorStorage handles fixed-size vector arrays
- [ ] Vector access is zero-copy and efficient
- [ ] Storage supports configurable vector dimensions
- [ ] Memory alignment enables SIMD optimizations
- [ ] Invalid dimension access returns proper errors
- [ ] Tests verify vector operations and memory safety

## Technical Details
Use Arrow arrays for efficient vector storage:
```rust
pub struct VectorStorage {
    vectors: FixedSizeListArray, // Arrow array for vectors
    vector_size: usize,
    capacity: usize,
    current_count: usize,
}
```

Leverage Arrow's memory layout for optimal performance and zero-copy operations.

## Proposed Solution

Based on the existing codebase structure and the requirement to use Arrow arrays for vector storage, I will implement the VectorStorage system as follows:

1. **VectorStorage Struct Design**:
   - Use Arrow's `FixedSizeListArray` for efficient vector storage with fixed dimensions
   - Leverage existing `MemoryMappedFile` infrastructure for persistence
   - Store vectors contiguously for optimal SIMD operations
   - Track current count and capacity for efficient space management

2. **Core Operations**:
   - `add_vector()`: Append new vectors with automatic capacity expansion
   - `get_vector()`: Zero-copy access to vectors by index
   - `update_vector()`: In-place vector updates
   - `remove_vector()`: Mark vectors as deleted (tombstone approach)
   - `compact()`: Remove deleted vectors and reclaim space

3. **Memory Layout**:
   - Header: Contains metadata (magic bytes, vector dimensions, capacity, count)
   - Vector Data: Contiguous Arrow FixedSizeListArray data
   - Proper alignment for SIMD operations (64-byte alignment for AVX-512)

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Extends existing `MemoryMappedFile` and `FileHeader` abstractions
   - Compatible with existing error handling patterns
   - Follows established testing patterns with isolated temporary directories

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Zero-copy vector access using Arrow's memory layout
   - SIMD-friendly alignment and data layout
   - Efficient batch operations using Arrow's computational kernels
   - Memory-mapped persistence with lazy loading

## Implementation Completed

Successfully implemented the VectorStorage system with all requirements:

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **VectorStorage Structure**: Complete implementation with memory-mapped file backend
2. **Fixed-Size Vector Arrays**: Efficient storage with proper alignment for SIMD operations
3. **Vector Operations**:

   - `get_vector()`: Zero-copy access to vectors by index
   - `update_vector()`: In-place vector updates with dimension validation
   - `remove_vector()`: Tombstone-based deletion marking vectors as deleted
   - `is_deleted()`: Check deletion status using NaN markers
4. **SIMD Alignment**: 64-byte alignment for AVX-512 compatibility
5. **Memory Safety**: Comprehensive bounds checking, alignment validation, and error handling
6. **Persistence**: Memory-mapped file persistence with checksum validation and atomic operations
7. **Read-Only Support**: Separate read-only mode for safe concurrent access
