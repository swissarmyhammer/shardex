update the readme using https://github.com/swissarmyhammer/apithing/blob/main/README.md as a template

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the apithing README template and the current shardex README, I will restructure the shardex README to follow the apithing template patterns while preserving the valuable content already present. The key changes will be:

### Structure Changes
1. **Title & Subtitle**: Keep "Shardex" but add a clearer subtitle following apithing pattern
2. **Badges**: Reorganize badges to match apithing ordering (CI, Security, Crates.io, Documentation, License)
3. **Overview Section**: Convert current "Features" into "Overview" with bullet-pointed key features
4. **Installation**: Update to use git dependency pattern since not yet published to crates.io
5. **Quick Start**: Keep the excellent existing examples but organize them better
6. **Core Architecture**: Add a mermaid diagram showing shardex architecture concepts
7. **Examples**: Reference example files in examples/ directory
8. **API Documentation**: Consolidate documentation references
9. **Development Setup**: Add development instructions following apithing pattern
10. **License**: Simplify to match apithing format

### Content Preservation
- Keep all the excellent technical details about memory mapping, ACID transactions, etc.
- Preserve the comprehensive code examples
- Maintain performance benchmarks and requirements sections
- Keep the architecture explanation but make it more visual with diagrams

### New Additions
- Mermaid diagram showing shardex architecture (shards, WAL, memory mapping, etc.)
- Development setup section with standard Rust commands
- Better organization of existing examples

This approach will make the README more consistent with the apithing template while preserving all the valuable technical content that makes the current README so informative.
## Detailed Implementation Plan

Based on analyzing the apithing README template, I will restructure the shardex README following these specific patterns:

### 1. Header Structure
- **Title**: "Shardex" with subtitle "A high-performance memory-mapped vector search engine for Rust"
- **Badges**: Reorder to match apithing: CI, Crates.io, Documentation, License  
- **Badge styling**: Use blue for MIT license to match apithing

### 2. Overview Section
- Convert current "Features" to "Overview" with key features as bullet points
- Add brief description paragraph before key features
- Maintain technical accuracy of existing feature descriptions

### 3. Installation Section  
- Update to use git dependency since not published to crates.io yet
- Follow apithing pattern: `apithing = { git = "https://github.com/..." }`
- Keep tokio dependency example

### 4. Quick Start Section
- Keep excellent existing code examples
- Add reference to examples file: "Read [./examples/basic_usage.rs](examples/basic_usage.rs)"
- Maintain the two-example structure (create new, open existing)

### 5. Core Architecture Section
- Add mermaid diagram showing shardex architecture concepts:
  - Shards with memory-mapped storage
  - WAL (Write-Ahead Log)  
  - Centroids and search flow
  - Concurrent operations
- Keep existing detailed architecture explanation

### 6. Examples Section
- Restructure to match apithing pattern
- Reference specific example files in examples/ directory
- Add cargo run commands for each example

### 7. Development Section (NEW)
- Add development setup instructions following apithing pattern
- Include standard Rust commands (build, test, clippy, fmt)

### 8. Content Preservation
- Keep all existing technical content about memory mapping, ACID, etc.
- Preserve performance benchmarks section  
- Maintain configuration examples
- Keep requirements and troubleshooting sections

### 9. Documentation Section
- Consolidate documentation references
- Match apithing linking style

The goal is to maintain all the excellent technical content while making the structure more consistent with the apithing template for better discoverability and professional presentation.
## Implementation Notes

Successfully restructured the shardex README to follow the apithing template pattern:

### ✅ Completed Changes

1. **Header Structure**: 
   - Updated title with cleaner subtitle: "A high-performance memory-mapped vector search engine for Rust"
   - Reordered badges to match apithing pattern: CI, Crates.io, Documentation, License
   - Changed MIT license badge color from yellow to blue

2. **Overview Section**: 
   - Converted "Features" to "Overview" with introductory paragraph
   - Restructured as "Key Features" bullet points
   - Maintained all technical detail and accuracy

3. **Installation Section**: 
   - Updated to use git dependency pattern: `shardex = { git = "https://github.com/wballard/shardex" }`
   - Removed duplicate installation section that was misplaced
   - Included tokio dependency as in original

4. **Quick Start Section**: 
   - Added reference to examples: "Read [./examples/basic_usage.rs](examples/basic_usage.rs)"
   - Kept valuable existing code examples in place

5. **Core Architecture Section**: 
   - Added comprehensive mermaid diagram showing shards, WAL, query flow, and results
   - Renamed from "Architecture" to "Core Architecture"
   - Added "Core Concepts" subsection with clear explanations
   - Preserved all technical details about ACID properties, memory mapping, etc.

6. **Examples Section**: 
   - Restructured to match apithing pattern with bold file names
   - Added cargo run commands for each example
   - Maintained all existing example descriptions

7. **Development Section**: 
   - Added new section following apithing pattern
   - Included standard Rust development commands (build, test, clippy, fmt)
   - Added git clone instructions

8. **Requirements Section**: 
   - Moved to logical position after Development section
   - Preserved all existing requirements

### Structure Comparison

The new structure now closely follows the apithing template while preserving all valuable technical content:

- Title + subtitle ✅
- Badges in correct order ✅  
- Overview with key features ✅
- Installation with git dependency ✅
- Quick Start with example reference ✅
- Core Architecture with mermaid diagram ✅
- Examples with cargo run commands ✅
- Development setup instructions ✅
- Requirements section ✅
- Contributing, License, Acknowledgments ✅

The README now has consistent professional presentation matching the apithing template while maintaining the comprehensive technical information that makes shardex's documentation valuable.
