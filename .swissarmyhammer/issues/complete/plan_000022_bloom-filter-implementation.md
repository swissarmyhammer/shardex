# Step 22: Bloom Filter Implementation for Document IDs

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement bloom filter functionality for efficient document ID lookups across shards.

## Tasks
- Create bloom filter data structure with configurable size
- Implement hash functions for document ID insertion and testing
- Add serialization support for memory-mapped storage
- Support bloom filter merging for shard operations
- Include false positive rate configuration and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bloom filter efficiently tests document ID membership
- [ ] Configurable size balances memory usage and false positive rate
- [ ] Hash functions provide good distribution for ULIDs
- [ ] Serialization works with memory-mapped files
- [ ] Tests verify correctness and false positive rates
- [ ] Performance meets requirements for high-frequency operations

## Technical Details
```rust
pub struct BloomFilter {
    bit_array: Vec<u64>,    // Memory-mapped bitset
    hash_functions: usize,  // Number of hash functions
    capacity: usize,        // Expected number of elements
    inserted_count: usize,  // Actual number of insertions
}

impl BloomFilter {
    pub fn new(capacity: usize, false_positive_rate: f64) -> Self;
    pub fn insert(&mut self, document_id: DocumentId);
    pub fn contains(&self, document_id: DocumentId) -> bool;
    pub fn merge(&mut self, other: &BloomFilter) -> Result<(), ShardexError>;
}
```

Use multiple hash functions (typically 3-5) for optimal false positive rate.
## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase, I will implement a bloom filter module with the following approach:

### 1. Core Data Structure
- Create a `BloomFilter` struct that uses `Vec<u64>` for the bit array to enable memory mapping
- Support configurable capacity and false positive rate for optimal performance
- Include metadata tracking for insertion count and configuration parameters

### 2. Hash Functions
- Use multiple independent hash functions (3-5) for optimal false positive rates
- Leverage high-quality hash functions from the `fxhash` crate for consistent distribution
- Optimize hash functions specifically for ULID-based DocumentId patterns

### 3. Memory Mapping Compatibility
- Design the bloom filter to be compatible with bytemuck Pod/Zeroable traits
- Use fixed-size layouts that can be directly memory-mapped
- Include proper headers with magic bytes and version information

### 4. Operations
- `insert()`: Add document IDs with multiple hash function bits set
- `contains()`: Test membership using all hash functions
- `merge()`: Combine bloom filters using bitwise OR operations
- `clear()`: Reset all bits for reuse

### 5. Configuration and Monitoring
- Calculate optimal bit array size and hash function count from capacity and false positive rate
- Track actual false positive rate through usage statistics
- Provide builder pattern for easy configuration

### 6. Integration Points
- Follow existing patterns from other modules (config, structures, memory)
- Use DocumentId type from identifiers module
- Integrate with ShardexError for consistent error handling
- Support JSON serialization for debugging and monitoring

### Implementation Files:
- `src/bloom_filter.rs` - Main bloom filter implementation
- Tests embedded in the same file following existing patterns
- Export through `src/lib.rs`

This approach maintains consistency with the existing codebase architecture while providing the performance and functionality required for efficient document ID lookups across shards.
