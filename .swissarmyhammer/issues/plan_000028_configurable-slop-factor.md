# Step 28: Configurable Slop Factor

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement configurable slop factor system for balancing search accuracy versus performance.

## Tasks
- Create slop factor configuration and validation
- Implement dynamic shard selection based on slop factor
- Add performance monitoring for different slop values
- Support adaptive slop factor based on index characteristics
- Include slop factor impact analysis and reporting

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Slop factor controls number of candidate shards searched
- [ ] Configuration validates slop factor ranges and constraints
- [ ] Performance monitoring shows slop factor impact
- [ ] Adaptive selection optimizes for index characteristics
- [ ] Tests verify slop factor behavior and performance
- [ ] Documentation explains slop factor trade-offs

## Technical Details
```rust
pub struct SlopFactorConfig {
    default_factor: usize,
    min_factor: usize,
    max_factor: usize,
    adaptive_enabled: bool,
    performance_threshold_ms: u64,
}

impl ShardexIndex {
    pub fn calculate_optimal_slop(&self, vector_size: usize, shard_count: usize) -> usize;
    pub fn select_shards_with_slop(&self, query: &[f32], slop: usize) -> Vec<ShardId>;
}
```

Include automatic slop factor tuning based on search performance and accuracy metrics.

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the existing codebase, I will implement a comprehensive configurable slop factor system that builds on the current implementation. Here's my approach:

### 1. Enhanced Configuration System
- Create a new `SlopFactorConfig` struct within the config module that provides:
  - `default_factor: usize` - default slop factor for searches
  - `min_factor: usize` - minimum allowed slop factor
  - `max_factor: usize` - maximum allowed slop factor  
  - `adaptive_enabled: bool` - enable/disable adaptive slop factor selection
  - `performance_threshold_ms: u64` - threshold for performance-based optimization

### 2. Dynamic Shard Selection Enhancement
- Extend the existing `find_nearest_shards` method in `ShardexIndex` to support:
  - Adaptive slop factor calculation based on index characteristics
  - Performance-based slop factor adjustment
  - Caching of optimal slop factors for different query patterns

### 3. Performance Monitoring Integration
- Extend existing `SearchMetrics` in `search_coordinator.rs` to track:
  - Slop factor usage statistics
  - Performance impact per slop factor value
  - Accuracy metrics for different slop factor settings
  - Adaptive adjustment history

### 4. Adaptive Selection Algorithm
- Implement `calculate_optimal_slop` method that considers:
  - Total number of shards in the index
  - Vector dimensionality
  - Historical search performance data
  - Query pattern characteristics

### 5. Implementation Strategy
The implementation will use Test-Driven Development with the following approach:
1. Write failing tests for each component
2. Implement minimal functionality to pass tests
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Extend functionality incrementally

This approach maintains backward compatibility while adding the requested configurable slop factor functionality with performance monitoring and adaptive selection capabilities.

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

The implementation follows Test-Driven Development principles and maintains full backward compatibility. The enhanced configuration system allows users to:

1. **Basic Configuration**: Set simple slop factor ranges with validation
2. **Adaptive Mode**: Enable automatic slop factor optimization
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track the impact of different slop factor settings
4. **Analysis & Reporting**: Get insights and recommendations for optimization

### ðŸš€ Usage Examples

```rust
// Basic configuration with validation
let slop_config = SlopFactorConfig::new()
    .default_factor(5)
    .min_factor(2)
    .max_factor(20)
    .adaptive_enabled(true)
    .build()?;

let config = ShardexConfig::new()
    .slop_factor_config(slop_config);

// Adaptive search (automatically selects optimal slop factor)
let results = coordinator.coordinate_search_adaptive(&query, 10, None).await?;

// Get performance analysis
let analysis = coordinator.get_slop_factor_analysis().await;
println!("Recommendation: {}", analysis.recommendation);
```

All acceptance criteria have been met with robust implementation, comprehensive testing, and performance monitoring capabilities.
