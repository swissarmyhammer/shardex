# Step 18: WAL Segment Management

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement Write-Ahead Log segment management with fixed-size memory-mapped segments.

## Tasks
- Create WAL segment structure with fixed-size layout
- Implement segment creation, opening, and rotation
- Add segment pointer management for current write position
- Support segment cleanup after successful flush
- Include segment integrity validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WAL segments are fixed-size and memory-mapped
- [ ] Segment rotation handles capacity limits properly
- [ ] Write pointers track current position accurately
- [ ] Cleanup removes obsolete segments safely
- [ ] Tests verify segment operations and edge cases
- [ ] Recovery can handle partial segment writes

## Technical Details
```rust
pub struct WalSegment {
    id: u64,
    memory_map: MemoryMappedFile,
    write_pointer: AtomicUsize,
    capacity: usize,
    file_path: PathBuf,
}

pub struct WalManager {
    current_segment: WalSegment,
    segment_size: usize,
    directory: PathBuf,
    next_segment_id: u64,
}
```

Use atomic operations for thread-safe write pointer updates and include segment checksums for integrity.

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the existing codebase, I will implement WAL segment management with the following approach:

### Design Overview
- **WalSegment**: Fixed-size memory-mapped segments with atomic write pointer management
- **WalManager**: Manages segment lifecycle, rotation, and cleanup
- **Atomic Operations**: Thread-safe write pointer updates using AtomicUsize
- **Memory Mapping**: Leverage existing MemoryMappedFile infrastructure
- **Integrity**: Segment checksums using StandardHeader validation

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create WAL Module Structure**
   - New `src/wal.rs` module 
   - `WalSegment` struct with memory-mapped file and atomic write pointer
   - `WalManager` for segment lifecycle management

2. **WalSegment Design**
   ```rust
   pub struct WalSegment {
       id: u64,
       memory_map: MemoryMappedFile,
       write_pointer: AtomicUsize,
       capacity: usize,
       file_path: PathBuf,
   }
   ```

3. **Key Features**
   - Fixed-size segments using existing memory mapping
   - Atomic write pointer for thread-safe appends
   - Segment rotation when capacity reached
   - Integrity validation with StandardHeader and checksums
   - Recovery support for partial writes

4. **Integration Points**
   - Use existing `DirectoryLayout` for WAL file management
   - Leverage `MemoryMappedFile` for all file operations
   - Follow existing error handling patterns with `ShardexError::Wal`
   - Use `StandardHeader` for segment metadata and integrity

5. **Test Strategy**
   - Unit tests for segment operations using TestEnvironment
   - Concurrent access tests with multiple writers
   - Recovery tests for partial segment writes
   - Edge case tests for capacity limits and rotation

### Implementation Steps
1. Create failing tests for basic WalSegment operations
2. Implement WalSegment struct with create/open methods
3. Add atomic write pointer management
4. Implement WalManager for segment lifecycle
5. Add segment rotation and cleanup logic
6. Implement integrity validation and recovery
7. Add comprehensive test coverage

This design leverages the existing infrastructure and follows established patterns in the codebase.
