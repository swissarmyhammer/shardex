# Implement Pointer Corruption Repair in Integrity Module

## Description
The structural inconsistency repair logic in the integrity module returns a placeholder indicating that pointer corruption repair is not yet implemented. This prevents proper recovery from pointer corruption issues.

## Location
- **File**: `src/integrity.rs`
- **Lines**: 2225-2232

## Current State
```rust
// This would validate all offsets and pointers in the structure
notes.push("Offset validation would require scanning entire file".to_string());

Ok((
    false,
    "Pointer corruption repair not yet implemented".to_string(),
    notes,
))
```

## Required Implementation
1. Implement offset and pointer validation logic
2. Scan entire file structure to validate all pointers
3. Detect and repair corrupted pointers where possible
4. Return appropriate success/failure status
5. Provide detailed repair notes and actions taken

## Impact
- Enables recovery from pointer corruption scenarios
- Improves structural integrity validation
- Essential for comprehensive data recovery operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace placeholder with full implementation
- [ ] Complete offset validation scanning
- [ ] Pointer corruption detection logic
- [ ] Repair mechanisms for recoverable pointer issues
- [ ] Detailed logging and reporting of repair actions
- [ ] Unit tests covering various pointer corruption scenarios
- [ ] Integration with existing integrity checking workflows
