# Step 30: Remove Documents Transaction Handling

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement complete transaction handling for document removal with WAL integration and bloom filter updates.

## Tasks
- Create remove documents transaction workflow
- Implement WAL recording for removal operations
- Add efficient document lookup using bloom filters
- Support batch document removal
- Include centroid updates after removals

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove operations are recorded in WAL before shard updates
- [ ] Bloom filters optimize document lookup performance
- [ ] Batch removal processes multiple documents efficiently
- [ ] Centroids are updated correctly after removals
- [ ] Tests verify removal correctness and performance
- [ ] Transaction integrity is maintained throughout operations

## Technical Details
```rust
impl Shardex {
    pub async fn remove_documents(&mut self, document_ids: Vec<DocumentId>) -> Result<(), ShardexError>;
    
    async fn remove_documents_transaction(&mut self, document_ids: Vec<DocumentId>) -> Result<(), ShardexError> {
        // 1. Record in WAL
        // 2. Find candidate shards using bloom filters
        // 3. Remove from each shard
        // 4. Update bloom filters
        // 5. Update centroids
        // 6. Advance WAL pointer
    }
}
```

Include removal statistics reporting and efficient multi-shard removal coordination.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase, I understand that document removal transaction handling needs to be implemented to match the existing add_postings transaction handling. Here's my implementation plan:

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update remove_documents method in ShardexImpl**: The method already exists but needs refinement to use proper DocumentId types and ensure the transaction workflow matches the pattern used in add_postings
2. **Implement remove_documents_transaction workflow**: Follow the established pattern: 
   - Record operations in WAL via batch processor
   - Keep operations in pending_shard_operations
   - Apply to shards during flush after WAL commit
3. **Enhance bloom filter integration**: Ensure bloom filters are updated efficiently during document removal to maintain lookup performance
4. **Add comprehensive tests**: Verify WAL integration, transaction atomicity, and bloom filter updates
5. **Update centroids after removal**: Ensure shard centroids are recalculated when documents are removed

### Key Technical Details

The implementation will follow the established transaction pattern:
```rust
impl Shardex {
    async fn remove_documents(&mut self, document_ids: Vec<u128>) -> Result<(), ShardexError> {
        // 1. Convert to DocumentId types and validate
        // 2. Create WalOperation::RemoveDocument operations  
        // 3. Add to batch processor for WAL recording
        // 4. Track in pending_shard_operations for post-WAL shard updates
    }
    
    async fn apply_operation_to_shards(&mut self, operation: &WalOperation) -> Result<(), ShardexError> {
        // For RemoveDocument operations:
        // 1. Find candidate shards using bloom filters (optimization for future)
        // 2. Remove from each shard that might contain the document
        // 3. Update bloom filters after removal
        // 4. Trigger centroid updates if needed
    }
}
```

The existing infrastructure (WalOperation::RemoveDocument, batch processor, WAL replay) is already in place - we just need to ensure the remove_documents method properly uses it and applies operations to shards correctly.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for remove_documents method with various edge cases
- Integration tests for WAL transaction handling
- Recovery tests to ensure WAL replay works correctly
- Performance tests for batch document removal
- Bloom filter efficiency validation


## Implementation Completed ✅

The complete transaction handling for document removal has been successfully implemented and tested. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Key Features Implemented

1. **Complete Transaction Workflow**: 
   - Remove operations are recorded in WAL before shard updates ✅
   - Batch processing with configurable intervals ✅
   - Atomic operations with proper error handling ✅

2. **Efficient Document Lookup**: 
   - Bloom filters optimize document lookup performance ✅
   - False positives are handled correctly (expected behavior) ✅
   - Multi-shard removal coordination ✅

3. **Batch Document Removal**: 
   - Support for removing multiple documents in single transaction ✅
   - Proper validation of document IDs ✅
   - Efficient processing of large batches ✅

4. **Centroid Updates**: 
   - Centroids are updated correctly after removals using incremental mean formula ✅
   - Existing test coverage for centroid removal logic ✅

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 
   - Added 8 new comprehensive tests covering all aspects ✅
   - WAL integration tests ✅
   - Transaction atomicity tests ✅
   - Edge case handling (empty lists, nonexistent documents) ✅
   - Mixed add/remove operation tests ✅

### Technical Implementation Details

The `remove_documents` method follows the established transaction pattern:

```rust
async fn remove_documents(&mut self, document_ids: Vec<u128>) -> Result<(), ShardexError> {
    // 1. Convert to DocumentId types and validate
    // 2. Create WalOperation::RemoveDocument operations  
    // 3. Add to batch processor for WAL recording
    // 4. Track in pending_shard_operations for post-WAL shard updates
}
```

The `apply_operation_to_shards` method handles RemoveDocument operations by:
1. Iterating through all shards that might contain the document
2. Using bloom filters for efficient pre-filtering (with expected false positives)
3. Removing documents from each shard
4. Updating centroids using the incremental removal formula
5. Updating shard metadata and statistics

### Test Results

- **Total tests added**: 8 comprehensive test functions
- **Test coverage includes**: Basic functionality, batch processing, WAL integration, transaction atomicity, edge cases, and mixed operations
- **All new tests passing**: ✅
- **Existing functionality preserved**: ✅

The implementation is complete and ready for production use.
