# Implement Concurrent Performance Demo

## Description
The concurrent performance demo test file exists but contains only a placeholder comment indicating the performance demo is not currently implemented.

## Location
- **File**: `tests/concurrent_performance_demo.rs`
- **Line**: 6

## Current State
```rust
// Placeholder file - performance demo not currently implemented
```

## Required Implementation
1. Create comprehensive concurrent performance demonstration
2. Include various workload scenarios (read/write/mixed)
3. Demonstrate performance under different concurrency levels
4. Measure and report key performance metrics
5. Provide benchmarking utilities for ongoing performance monitoring

## Impact
- Provides concrete performance validation
- Demonstrates library capabilities under concurrent load
- Enables performance regression detection
- Serves as performance documentation and examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace placeholder with full implementation
- [ ] Multiple concurrent workload scenarios
- [ ] Performance metrics collection and reporting
- [ ] Configurable concurrency levels and test parameters
- [ ] Clear documentation of test scenarios and expected outcomes
- [ ] Integration with existing test suite
