# Duplicate Monitoring Structures Between monitoring.rs and monitoring_broken.rs

## Description
The codebase contains duplicate monitoring structures and implementations between `src/monitoring.rs` and `src/monitoring_broken.rs`, creating maintenance burden and potential inconsistencies.

## Duplicated Structures Found

### Core Monitoring Types
1. **AtomicCounters**:
   - `monitoring.rs:101`: `impl Default for AtomicCounters`
   - `monitoring_broken.rs:96`: `impl Default for AtomicCounters`

2. **ComplexMetrics**:
   - `monitoring.rs:151`: `impl Default for ComplexMetrics`
   - `monitoring_broken.rs:146`: `impl Default for ComplexMetrics`

3. **MetricsSnapshot**:
   - `monitoring.rs:183`: `impl Default for MetricsSnapshot`
   - `monitoring_broken.rs:207`: `impl Default for MetricsSnapshot`

4. **PerformanceMonitor**:
   - `monitoring.rs:584`: `impl Default for PerformanceMonitor`
   - `monitoring_broken.rs:772`: `impl Default for PerformanceMonitor`

5. **PercentileCalculator**:
   - `monitoring.rs:590`: `impl Default for PercentileCalculator`
   - `monitoring_broken.rs:929`: `impl Default for PercentileCalculator`

6. **HistoricalData**:
   - Present in `monitoring_broken.rs:872` but not in `monitoring.rs`

### Derive Attribute Patterns
Both files contain identical derive patterns:
```rust
// monitoring.rs and monitoring_broken.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
```

### Duplicated Metrics Types
Both files define similar metric structs with identical naming patterns:
- `DocumentTextMetrics`
- `ResourceMetrics`  
- `WriteMetrics`
- `BloomFilterMetrics`

## Issues Identified

### 1. Code Duplication
Near-identical implementations across two files create maintenance overhead.

### 2. Inconsistent Behavior
The `monitoring_broken.rs` file suggests it may have different behavior or be outdated.

### 3. Import Confusion
Both modules export similar types, creating potential import conflicts.

### 4. No Clear Purpose
The purpose of having both `monitoring.rs` and `monitoring_broken.rs` is unclear.

### 5. Different Implementation Details
While structures are similar, implementation details may differ between files.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Potential Reasons for Duplication
1. **Refactoring in Progress**: `monitoring_broken.rs` may be legacy code being replaced
2. **Feature Experimentation**: One file may contain experimental features
3. **Backup Copy**: One file may be a backup during major changes
4. **Version Branching**: Different versions of monitoring for different use cases

## Proposed Resolution

### Option 1: Consolidation
If `monitoring_broken.rs` is legacy:
1. Migrate any unique functionality from `monitoring_broken.rs` to `monitoring.rs`
2. Update all imports to use `monitoring.rs`
3. Delete `monitoring_broken.rs`
4. Update lib.rs exports

### Option 2: Clear Separation
If both files serve different purposes:
1. Rename files to reflect their specific purposes
2. Document the differences and use cases
3. Ensure no structural duplication
4. Create clear import paths

### Option 3: Module Restructuring  
Create a monitoring module hierarchy:
```rust
src/monitoring/
├── mod.rs          // Common exports
├── core.rs         // Core monitoring types
├── metrics.rs      // Metrics collection
└── legacy.rs       // Legacy implementations (if needed)
```

## Investigation Required
1. **Determine Purpose**: What is the intended purpose of `monitoring_broken.rs`?
2. **Usage Analysis**: Which files import from each monitoring module?
3. **Functionality Comparison**: What are the differences in implementation?
4. **Test Coverage**: Do tests depend on both versions?

## Impact
- 100+ lines of duplicated code
- Maintenance burden when updating monitoring logic
- Potential runtime confusion if both are used
- Import ambiguity for developers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Determine the purpose and status of both monitoring files
- [ ] Eliminate structural duplication
- [ ] Consolidate or clearly separate functionality
- [ ] Update all imports to use the correct module
- [ ] Remove unused/legacy code if identified
- [ ] Document the monitoring architecture clearly
