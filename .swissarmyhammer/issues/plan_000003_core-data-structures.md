# Step 3: Core Data Structures

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement the core data structures (Posting, SearchResult, IndexStats) that form the API surface.

## Tasks
- Implement `Posting` struct with memory-mapped layout
- Implement `SearchResult` struct for search responses
- Implement `IndexStats` for monitoring and observability
- Add proper validation for vector dimensions
- Ensure structures are memory-map compatible

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Posting struct supports document ID, start, length, and vector
- [ ] SearchResult includes similarity scores
- [ ] IndexStats provides comprehensive metrics
- [ ] All structures support zero-copy serialization
- [ ] Vector dimension validation prevents mismatched data
- [ ] Tests cover structure creation and validation

## Technical Details
```rust
pub struct Posting {
    pub document_id: DocumentId,
    pub start: u32,
    pub length: u32, 
    pub vector: Vec<f32>,
}

pub struct SearchResult {
    pub document_id: DocumentId,
    pub start: u32,
    pub length: u32,
    pub vector: Vec<f32>,
    pub similarity_score: f32,
}
```

Structures must be compatible with bytemuck for direct memory mapping.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing codebase and requirements, I will implement the core data structures with the following approach:

### 1. Core Data Structures Implementation

**Posting struct:**
- Use DocumentId from identifiers module instead of raw u128
- Implement with bytemuck traits for zero-copy memory mapping
- Add vector dimension validation
- Support fixed-size layout for memory mapping

**SearchResult struct:**
- Mirror Posting structure with added similarity_score field
- Use same DocumentId type for consistency
- Implement bytemuck traits for memory mapping compatibility

**IndexStats struct:**
- Provide comprehensive monitoring metrics
- Include memory usage tracking
- Support serialization for observability

### 2. Technical Approach

- Create new module `src/structures.rs` for all core data structures
- Use `#[repr(C)]` for predictable memory layout
- Implement bytemuck Pod and Zeroable traits for all structures
- Add vector dimension validation at structure level
- Provide builder patterns where appropriate
- Use existing error types from error.rs module

### 3. Memory Layout Considerations

- Fixed-size structures compatible with memory mapping
- Vec<f32> will need special handling for memory mapping (likely store as pointer + length)
- Ensure proper alignment for efficient access
- Use little-endian byte ordering for cross-platform compatibility

### 4. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for structure creation and validation
- Memory layout and bytemuck compatibility tests
- Serialization/deserialization round-trip tests
- Vector dimension validation tests
- Performance tests for memory access patterns

This approach ensures zero-copy operations, proper memory mapping support, and maintains type safety with the existing identifier system.
