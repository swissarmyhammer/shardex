# Step 27: Duplicate Elimination in Results

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement comprehensive duplicate elimination for search results and shard operations.

## Tasks
- Create duplicate detection for search results
- Implement document-level deduplication strategies
- Add posting-level duplicate handling
- Support configurable deduplication policies
- Include performance optimization for large result sets

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search results contain no duplicate postings
- [ ] Document-level deduplication handles multiple postings correctly
- [ ] Configurable policies support different use cases
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable for large result sets
- [ ] Tests verify deduplication correctness and completeness
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized during deduplication

## Technical Details
```rust
pub enum DeduplicationPolicy {
    None,
    ByDocumentId,
    ByDocumentAndPosition,
    Exact,
}

pub struct ResultDeduplicator {
    policy: DeduplicationPolicy,
    seen_documents: HashSet<DocumentId>,
    seen_postings: HashSet<(DocumentId, u32, u32)>,
}

impl ResultDeduplicator {
    pub fn deduplicate(&mut self, results: Vec<SearchResult>) -> Vec<SearchResult>;
}
```

Use efficient hash-based deduplication and consider similarity-based duplicate detection for fuzzy matching.
