# Step 10: Individual Shard Creation and Management

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement individual shard creation, initialization, and basic management operations.

## Tasks
- Create Shard struct combining vector and posting storage
- Implement shard creation with configurable capacity
- Add shard loading from existing files
- Support shard metadata tracking (ID, creation time, stats)
- Include basic shard validation and integrity checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Shard combines VectorStorage and PostingStorage
- [ ] Shard creation initializes both vector and posting files
- [ ] Loading validates shard integrity and configuration
- [ ] Shard metadata tracks essential statistics
- [ ] Tests verify shard creation, loading, and validation
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios

## Technical Details
```rust
pub struct Shard {
    id: ShardId,
    vector_storage: VectorStorage,
    posting_storage: PostingStorage,
    capacity: usize,
    vector_size: usize,
    directory: PathBuf,
}

impl Shard {
    pub async fn create(id: ShardId, capacity: usize, vector_size: usize, directory: PathBuf) -> Result<Self, ShardexError>;
    pub async fn open(id: ShardId, directory: PathBuf) -> Result<Self, ShardexError>;
}
```

Ensure atomic creation and proper cleanup on failures.

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the existing codebase, I will implement the Shard struct that combines VectorStorage and PostingStorage to create complete individual shards. The implementation follows these key principles:

### 1. Architecture Design
- **Shard struct** will wrap both VectorStorage and PostingStorage instances
- **Atomic creation** ensures both storages are created successfully or neither is created
- **Configuration validation** ensures vector dimensions and capacity match between storages
- **Directory-based organization** with shard files using consistent naming patterns

### 2. Implementation Steps
1. **Create shard.rs module** with the main Shard struct
2. **Implement Shard::create()** for atomic shard creation with validation
3. **Implement Shard::open()** for loading existing shards with integrity checks
4. **Add shard metadata tracking** for ID, creation time, and statistics
5. **Implement shard operations** for adding, getting, and managing postings with vectors
6. **Add comprehensive validation** and integrity checking methods
7. **Create thorough test coverage** using TestEnvironment pattern

### 3. Key Design Decisions
- **File naming**: Use `{shard_id}.vectors` and `{shard_id}.postings` in the shard directory
- **Atomic operations**: Create temporary files first, then rename atomically on success  
- **Error handling**: Clean up partial state on any failure during creation
- **Capacity synchronization**: Ensure both vector and posting storages have same capacity
- **Metadata integration**: Track shard statistics and provide health monitoring

### 4. API Structure
```rust
pub struct Shard {
    id: ShardId,
    vector_storage: VectorStorage,
    posting_storage: PostingStorage,
    capacity: usize,
    vector_size: usize,
    directory: PathBuf,
    metadata: ShardMetadata,
}

pub struct ShardMetadata {
    pub created_at: SystemTime,
    pub current_count: usize,
    pub active_count: usize,
}
```

### 5. Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** for all creation and loading scenarios
- **Error handling tests** for partial failures and corruption detection
- **Integrity validation tests** for cross-storage consistency
- **Concurrent access tests** within single process constraints
- **Performance validation** for large shard operations

This approach leverages the existing robust VectorStorage and PostingStorage implementations while providing a clean, safe interface for complete shard management.
