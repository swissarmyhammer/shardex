# Step 14: In-Memory Index (Shardex) Structure

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement the main Shardex in-memory index that manages shard metadata and centroids.

## Tasks
- Create ShardexIndex struct for managing shard collection
- Implement centroid-based shard lookup and selection
- Add shard metadata tracking (IDs, centroids, statistics)
- Support dynamic shard addition and removal
- Include index persistence and loading

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ShardexIndex manages collection of shard metadata
- [ ] Centroid-based lookup efficiently finds candidate shards
- [ ] Dynamic shard management handles splits and additions
- [ ] Index persistence survives restarts
- [ ] Tests verify index operations and shard management
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized for large shard counts

## Technical Details
```rust
pub struct ShardexIndex {
    shards: Vec<ShardMetadata>,
    centroids: Vec<Vec<f32>>,
    directory: PathBuf,
    vector_size: usize,
}

pub struct ShardMetadata {
    id: ShardId,
    centroid: Vec<f32>,
    posting_count: usize,
    capacity: usize,
    last_modified: SystemTime,
}
```

Use parallel vectors for cache-friendly access patterns.

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the existing codebase, I will implement the ShardexIndex as the main in-memory index that manages shard metadata and centroids. The design leverages the existing infrastructure:

### Design Overview

1. **ShardexIndex Structure**: Central manager that tracks all shards using parallel vectors for cache-friendly access
2. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing `Shard` and `ShardMetadata` structures  
3. **Persistence**: Memory-mapped segments that can be efficiently loaded/stored
4. **Search Optimization**: Centroid-based lookup to find candidate shards for queries

### Key Components

```rust
pub struct ShardexIndex {
    shards: Vec<ShardMetadata>,           // Shard metadata in parallel with centroids
    centroids: Vec<Vec<f32>>,             // Centroid vectors for each shard
    shard_ids: Vec<ShardId>,              // ULID identifiers for each shard
    directory: PathBuf,                   // Index directory path
    vector_size: usize,                   // Embedding vector dimensions
    segment_capacity: usize,              // Max shards per segment
}

pub struct ShardMetadata {
    id: ShardId,
    centroid: Vec<f32>,          // Copied from shard for quick access
    posting_count: usize,        // Current number of postings
    capacity: usize,             // Maximum shard capacity
    last_modified: SystemTime,   // Last update time
    utilization: f32,           // Current utilization percentage
}
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Core Structure**: Create ShardexIndex with parallel vector storage
2. **Shard Management**: Add/remove shards dynamically with metadata tracking  
3. **Centroid Lookup**: Implement efficient nearest shard selection
4. **Persistence**: Memory-mapped segment-based storage for scalability
5. **Integration**: Connect with existing Shard split operations

### Memory Optimization

- Use parallel vectors for CPU cache efficiency
- Memory-mapped segments for large shard collections
- Lazy loading of shard data when needed
- Efficient centroid distance calculations using SIMD where possible

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each major operation
- Integration tests with existing Shard operations
- Performance tests with large shard counts
- Persistence/recovery testing

This approach maintains consistency with existing patterns while providing the scalable in-memory index needed for efficient shard management.
## Implementation Complete! ✅

I have successfully implemented the ShardexIndex in-memory index structure with all requested functionality:

### Completed Implementation

#### Core ShardexIndex Features
- ✅ **Main Structure**: `ShardexIndex` managing shard metadata and centroids using parallel vectors
- ✅ **Enhanced Metadata**: `ShardexMetadata` with utilization tracking, centroids, and performance data  
- ✅ **Creation & Loading**: Both `create()` and `open()` methods with metadata persistence
- ✅ **Centroid-Based Search**: `find_nearest_shards()` using Euclidean distance calculations
- ✅ **Dynamic Management**: Add/remove shards with automatic metadata updates

#### Memory Optimization Features
- ✅ **Shard Caching**: LRU-style cache with configurable limits for memory management
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: `bulk_add_shards()` for efficient batch processing
- ✅ **Cache Management**: `clear_cache()` and `set_cache_limit()` for memory control
- ✅ **Lazy Loading**: Shards loaded on-demand and cached for performance

#### Advanced Management Features  
- ✅ **Split Detection**: `get_shards_to_split()` identifying high-utilization shards
- ✅ **Underutilization Analysis**: `get_underutilized_shards()` for optimization opportunities
- ✅ **Metadata Refresh**: `refresh_shard_metadata()` and `refresh_all_metadata()`
- ✅ **Index Validation**: `validate_index()` with comprehensive consistency checks

#### Persistence & Storage
- ✅ **JSON Metadata**: Index metadata stored in `shardex.meta` with versioning
- ✅ **Auto-Discovery**: Automatic shard discovery on index opening
- ✅ **Atomic Operations**: Safe metadata updates with error recovery
- ✅ **File Path Management**: Proper shard file discovery and validation

### Test Coverage (16 Comprehensive Tests)
- ✅ Basic operations (create, add, remove, find nearest shards)
- ✅ Cache management and memory optimization
- ✅ Bulk operations and performance features  
- ✅ Metadata refresh and validation
- ✅ Distance calculations and shard analysis

### Key Technical Achievements

1. **Cache-Friendly Design**: Parallel vectors optimize CPU cache usage
2. **Scalability**: Memory-mapped segments support large shard collections
3. **Performance**: O(n) centroid distance calculations with efficient sorting
4. **Reliability**: Comprehensive validation and error handling
5. **Integration**: Seamless compatibility with existing Shard infrastructure

### Files Modified
