# Step 6: Memory-Mapped Vector Storage

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement fixed-size memory-mapped storage for embedding vectors with direct access capabilities.

## Tasks
- Create VectorStorage struct for memory-mapped vector arrays
- Implement fixed-size allocation with configurable dimensions
- Add direct vector access without copying
- Support vector addition, removal, and updates
- Ensure proper alignment for SIMD operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] VectorStorage handles fixed-size vector arrays
- [ ] Vector access is zero-copy and efficient
- [ ] Storage supports configurable vector dimensions
- [ ] Memory alignment enables SIMD optimizations
- [ ] Invalid dimension access returns proper errors
- [ ] Tests verify vector operations and memory safety

## Technical Details
Use Arrow arrays for efficient vector storage:
```rust
pub struct VectorStorage {
    vectors: FixedSizeListArray, // Arrow array for vectors
    vector_size: usize,
    capacity: usize,
    current_count: usize,
}
```

Leverage Arrow's memory layout for optimal performance and zero-copy operations.
