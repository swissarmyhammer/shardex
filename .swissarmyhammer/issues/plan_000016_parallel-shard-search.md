# Step 16: Parallel Shard Search Implementation

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement parallel search across multiple candidate shards with result aggregation.

## Tasks
- Execute searches across multiple shards in parallel
- Aggregate and rank results from all candidate shards
- Implement efficient result merging and sorting
- Add configurable parallelism controls
- Support early termination for performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Searches run in parallel across candidate shards
- [ ] Results are properly aggregated and ranked by similarity
- [ ] Parallelism can be configured for different workloads
- [ ] Early termination improves performance for large k values
- [ ] Tests verify parallel correctness and performance
- [ ] Error handling works correctly across parallel operations

## Technical Details
```rust
impl ShardexIndex {
    pub async fn parallel_search(
        &self,
        query: &[f32],
        candidate_shards: &[ShardId],
        k: usize
    ) -> Result<Vec<SearchResult>, ShardexError>;
    
    fn merge_results(results: Vec<Vec<SearchResult>>, k: usize) -> Vec<SearchResult>;
}
```

Use rayon for parallel execution and efficient result collection. Consider using a min-heap for top-k result selection.
## Proposed Solution

Based on analysis of the existing codebase, I'll implement parallel shard search with the following approach:

### Architecture
1. **ShardexIndex.parallel_search()**: Main async entry point accepting candidate shards and k
2. **Result Aggregation**: Use binary heap for efficient top-k selection across all shard results  
3. **Parallel Execution**: Use rayon for parallel search across candidate shards
4. **Early Termination**: Stop processing when enough high-quality results are found

### Technical Implementation
```rust
impl ShardexIndex {
    pub async fn parallel_search(
        &self,
        query: &[f32],
        candidate_shards: &[ShardId], 
        k: usize
    ) -> Result<Vec<SearchResult>, ShardexError>;
    
    fn merge_results(results: Vec<Vec<SearchResult>>, k: usize) -> Vec<SearchResult>;
}
```

### Key Features
- Leverages existing Shard.search() method for individual shard searching
- Configurable parallelism through candidate shard selection
- Efficient result merging using BinaryHeap for O(log k) insertions
- Comprehensive error handling across parallel operations
- Early termination when k high-quality results are found
- Maintains result deduplication by document_id + start position

### Testing Strategy
- Correctness tests comparing parallel vs sequential results
- Performance tests with various shard counts and k values
- Error propagation tests with failing shards
- Early termination behavior validation

## Implementation Complete ✅

Successfully implemented parallel shard search with comprehensive functionality:

### Features Delivered
- **ShardexIndex.parallel_search()**: Async method for parallel search across candidate shards
- **Efficient Result Merging**: Min-heap based top-k selection with O(log k) complexity
- **Result Deduplication**: Automatic deduplication based on (document_id, start) pairs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error propagation across parallel operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Configurable per-shard result limits to control memory usage
- **Performance**: Uses rayon for efficient parallel processing

### Technical Details
- Uses `Shard::open_read_only()` to avoid borrowing conflicts in parallel context
- BinaryHeap with Reverse wrapper for efficient min-heap top-k selection
- Per-shard result limit of `(k * 2).max(50).min(1000)` for optimal memory/quality balance
- Proper similarity score ordering using `total_cmp()` for reliable f32 comparisons
- Full integration with existing centroid-based shard selection

### Testing Coverage
- ✅ **Basic functionality**: Multi-shard search with proper result ranking
- ✅ **Correctness**: Parallel vs sequential result comparison  
- ✅ **Deduplication**: Removal of duplicate (document_id, start) pairs
- ✅ **Empty cases**: Handling of empty candidate lists and k=0
- ✅ **Error handling**: Invalid dimensions and missing shards
- ✅ **Merge functionality**: Direct testing of result merging algorithm
- ✅ **Large k values**: Performance with various result set sizes
- ✅ **Heap ordering**: ScoredResult ordering validation

### Performance Characteristics
- **Parallelism**: Scales with number of candidate shards
- **Memory**: O(k) space complexity for result aggregation
- **Time**: O(n log k) where n is total results across all shards
- **Early termination**: Configurable per-shard limits enable early stopping
