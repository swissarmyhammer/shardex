# Step 16: Parallel Shard Search Implementation

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/shardex/plan.md

## Goal
Implement parallel search across multiple candidate shards with result aggregation.

## Tasks
- Execute searches across multiple shards in parallel
- Aggregate and rank results from all candidate shards
- Implement efficient result merging and sorting
- Add configurable parallelism controls
- Support early termination for performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Searches run in parallel across candidate shards
- [ ] Results are properly aggregated and ranked by similarity
- [ ] Parallelism can be configured for different workloads
- [ ] Early termination improves performance for large k values
- [ ] Tests verify parallel correctness and performance
- [ ] Error handling works correctly across parallel operations

## Technical Details
```rust
impl ShardexIndex {
    pub async fn parallel_search(
        &self,
        query: &[f32],
        candidate_shards: &[ShardId],
        k: usize
    ) -> Result<Vec<SearchResult>, ShardexError>;
    
    fn merge_results(results: Vec<Vec<SearchResult>>, k: usize) -> Vec<SearchResult>;
}
```

Use rayon for parallel execution and efficient result collection. Consider using a min-heap for top-k result selection.
