# Refactor DocumentText Monitoring Stub Methods

## Description
Multiple monitoring methods in the `PerformanceMonitor` are marked as "stub for compatibility" and delegate to generic methods. These should be implemented as proper DocumentText-specific monitoring or removed if unnecessary.

## Location
- **File**: `src/monitoring.rs`
- **Lines**: 441, 459, 465, 472, 479, 500

## Current State
```rust
/// Record document text storage operation (stub for compatibility)
/// Record document text cache operation (stub for compatibility)  
/// Record document text concurrent operation (stub for compatibility)
/// Record document text pool operation (stub for compatibility)
/// Record document text async operation (stub for compatibility)
/// Record document text health check (stub for compatibility)
```

## Methods Affected
- `record_document_text_storage()`
- `record_document_text_cache()` 
- `record_document_text_concurrent()`
- `record_document_text_pool()`
- `record_document_text_async()`
- `record_document_text_health_check()`

## Required Action
1. **Decision**: Determine if DocumentText-specific monitoring is needed
2. **If Yes**: Implement proper DocumentText-specific metrics and storage
3. **If No**: Remove these stub methods and update callers to use generic methods
4. **Update Documentation**: Remove "stub for compatibility" comments
5. **Clean up**: Ensure no dead code remains

## Impact
- Removes placeholder/stub code
- Clarifies monitoring interface
- Either provides proper DocumentText monitoring or removes unnecessary complexity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All "stub for compatibility" comments removed
- [ ] Methods either properly implemented or removed
- [ ] Callers updated appropriately if methods removed
- [ ] No dead or placeholder code remains
- [ ] Documentation reflects actual implementation

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the code, I found that these stub methods are actually being used in two key places:

1. **Error handling code** (`src/error_handling.rs`) - 21 usages for health checks and storage operations
2. **Integration tests** (`tests/document_text_performance_integration_test.rs`) - 14 usages testing all stub methods

### Analysis

The stub methods are delegating to generic monitoring functionality:
- `record_document_text_storage()` → delegates to `record_write()`
- `record_document_text_cache()` → delegates to `record_bloom_filter_lookup()`
- `record_document_text_concurrent()` → increments operation counter
- `record_document_text_pool()` → updates bytes written counter
- `record_document_text_async()` → updates operation and success/failure counters
- `record_document_text_health_check()` → increments operation counter

### Decision: Remove Stub Methods

The stub methods don't add value and create unnecessary API surface. The delegation pattern makes them redundant. I will:

1. **Remove all 6 stub methods** from `PerformanceMonitor`
2. **Update callers** to use the appropriate generic methods directly:
   - Replace `record_document_text_storage()` with `record_write()`
   - Replace `record_document_text_cache()` with `record_bloom_filter_lookup()`
   - Replace other methods with direct counter updates or appropriate generic methods
3. **Update integration tests** to test the generic methods directly
4. **Ensure no functionality is lost** - all monitoring still works through generic methods

### Implementation Steps

1. Remove the 6 stub methods from `monitoring.rs`
2. Update `error_handling.rs` to use generic monitoring methods
3. Update the integration test to use generic methods
4. Run tests to ensure all monitoring functionality still works
5. Clean up the `DocumentTextOperation` enum if it's no longer needed

This approach eliminates duplicate code, simplifies the API, and maintains all monitoring functionality.
## Implementation Notes

Successfully removed all 6 stub methods from `PerformanceMonitor` and updated all callers to use generic monitoring methods:

### Changes Made

1. **Removed 6 stub methods from `monitoring.rs`** (lines 441-500):
   - `record_document_text_storage()`
   - `record_document_text_cache()`
   - `record_document_text_concurrent()`
   - `record_document_text_pool()`
   - `record_document_text_async()`
   - `record_document_text_health_check()`

2. **Updated `error_handling.rs`** (21 method calls replaced):
   - `record_document_text_storage()` with `Some(bytes)` → `record_write(duration, bytes, success)`
   - `record_document_text_storage()` with `None` → direct counter increment
   - `record_document_text_health_check()` → direct counter increment

3. **Updated integration test** (`document_text_performance_integration_test.rs`):
   - Replaced all 14 stub method calls with appropriate generic method calls
   - Removed `DocumentTextOperation` from imports

4. **Removed `DocumentTextOperation` enum**:
   - Deleted enum definition from `monitoring.rs`
   - Removed from exports in `lib.rs`

5. **Verified all functionality works**:
   - All monitoring unit tests pass (10 tests)
   - Performance integration test passes
   - Project compiles without errors

### Result

- **✅ All "stub for compatibility" comments removed**
- **✅ All stub methods removed**  
- **✅ Callers updated to use generic methods directly**
- **✅ No dead code remains**
- **✅ All monitoring functionality preserved**

The monitoring interface is now cleaner with only essential generic methods. All document text operations now use the same monitoring infrastructure as other operations, eliminating duplication and complexity.
